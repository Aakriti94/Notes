1. **What is meant by the line `#!/usr/bin/bash` ? Why do we use it at the top of the script?** <br>
Ans. It is a shebang line to set bash as a shell. It is present in `/bin` directory as default shell for executing command present in the file. It defines an absolute path `/usr/bin/bash` to the Bash shell. This is usually the default location of the Bash shell in almost all Unix-based operating systems. <br>
```
# to find where bash is located in our system  
$ which bash
/usr/bin/bash
```

  We can also use the `#!/usr/bin/bash` shebang line to pass extra parameters to the shell interpreter
  ```
  # The -r option enables restricted shell mode.
  #!/usr/bin/bash -r
  ```
  **Advantages:** <br>
    * Accurately point to an interpreter’s absolute path
    * Has relatively high security
    * We can pass additional parameters
    <br>
    <br>

  **Disadvantages:**  <br>
    * It has poor portability because different systems can have interpreters installed in different locations.


2. **What is meant by `#!/usr/bin/env bash` ?** <br>
Ans. It is also a shebang line used in script files to execute commands with the Bash shell. It uses the `env` command to display the environment variables present in the system and then execute commands with the defined interpreter. The env command works by instructing the system to look for the specified interpreter through the `$PATH` variable and use the first occurrence found.
```
# We can verify its location on our system using the which command
$ which env
/usr/bin/env
```
```
# display all current environment variables defined by the shell:
$ env
## -----------------
# it is a very long output so grepping it
$ env | grep SHELL
SHELL=/bin/bash
## -----------------
$ env | grep PATH
PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
# we can see that $PATH contains symlinks to /bin and other directories, separated by colons.
```

  **Advantages:** <br>
  * Automatically searching for the default version of the interpreter in the current environment.
  <br>
  <br>

  **Disadvantages:**  <br>
  * Doesn’t support multiple parameters. This is because the declared interpreter and its option are parsed as one argument.



    # specify a version of the interpreter to be used
    #!/usr/bin/env bashX.x


### Comparison

| `#!/usr/bin/bash` | `#!/usr/bin/env bash`|
|------|--------|
| Offers more security	| Offers more portability|
| More specific, since we have to declare the exact path to an interpreter | Automatically searches for the first occurrence of an interpreter in the environment|
| Can support extra parameters passed after the declaration of the interpreter | Cannot support extra parameters because the system reads them as a single command |
